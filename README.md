## k8s-deneme

### Every step in this project has been tested on Arm based Linux operating system by using "multipass.run" service.

#### The "hosts" file in the project is where we specify how to access the server with Ansible.

##### The "main.yml" file is our main "Ansible Playbook" file and Ansible will run the commands here in order.

###### You can use the command "ansible-playbook main.yml -i hosts" to run the project.
